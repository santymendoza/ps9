Reflection on the problem set

After each problem set, we'll ask you to reflect on your experience.
We care about your responses and will use them to help guide us in
creating and improving future assignments.

........................................................................
Please give us an honest (if approximate) estimate of how long (in
minutes) this problem set (in total, not just this file) took you to
complete.
